    "## Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common types of recommender systems are **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering (CF)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "Collaborative Filtering produces recommendations based on the knowledge of users attitude to items, that is it uses the `wisdom of the crowd` to recommend items.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content-Based\n",
    "Content-based recommender systems focus on the attributes of the items and give you recommendations based on the similarity between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "* In general, **Collaborative filtering (CF)** is more commonly used than **content-based** systems because it usually gives better results and is relatively easy to understand (from an overall implementation prespective).\n",
    "* The algorithm has the ability to do feature learning on its own, which means that it can start to learn for itself what features to use.\n",
    "* These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user-item association matrix.\n",
    "* spark.ml currently supports model-based collaborative filtering, in which users and products are described by a small set of latent factors that can be used to predict missing entries.\n",
    "* spark.ml uses the alternating least squares (ALS) algorithm to learn these latent factors.\n",
    "* Our data needs to be in a specific format to work with Spark's ALS Recommendation Algorithm.\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "#### ALS\n",
    "* ALS is basically a Matrix Factorization approach to implement a recommendation algorithm you decompose your large user/item matrix into lower dimensional user factors and item factors."
